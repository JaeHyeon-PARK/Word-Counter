There's a place in your heart 
and I know that it is love 
And this place could be much 
brighter than tomorrow 
And if you really try you'll find 
there's no need to cry 
In this place you'll feel 
there's no hurt or sorrow 
There are ways to get there 
if you care enough for the living 
Make a little space 
Make a better place 
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
and the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
for you and for me 
If you want to know 
why there's a love that cannot lie 
Love is strong it only cares 
for joyful giving 
If we try we shall see in this bliss 
We cannot feel fear or dread 
We stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always 
love's enough for us growing 
Make a better world 
make a better world 
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
and the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
for you and for me 
And the dream 
we were conceived in 
Will reveal a joyful face 
And the world we once believed in 
Will shine again in grace 
Then why do we keep strangling life 
Wound this earth crucify its soul 
Though it's plain to see 
this world is heavenly 
Be God's glow
We could fly so high 
Let our spirits never die 
In my heart I feel 
you are all my brothers 
Create a world with no fear 
Together we'll cry happy tears 
See the nations turn 
their swords into plowshares
We could really get there 
If you cared enough for the living 
Make a little space 
to make a better place
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
and the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place for you and for me 
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
and the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place for you and for me 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place for you and for me 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place for you and for me 
you and for me
you and for me
you and for me
you and for me
you and for me
you and for me
you and for me
